# Employee-Attrition-Project
### Project Summary
The Board of the human capital department of a large corporation I work for is worried about the relatively high
turnover of employees. As an analyst on the team assigned to this task, I am to provide a report to help the board better understand the situation:

* which employees are more likely to leave
* which department has the highest employee turnover and which one has the lowest
* which variables seem to be indicators of employee departure

### Data Sources
